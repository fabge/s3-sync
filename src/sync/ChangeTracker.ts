/**
 * Tracks local vault file events and maintains a set of "dirty" paths
 * that have changed since the last sync.
 *
 * ChangeTracker does not write to the journal or hash file content. It
 * simply records which paths were created,
 * modified, deleted, or renamed so the SyncPlanner can prioritise them
 * during the next sync cycle.
 *
 * ## Dirty-path tracking pattern
 * Vault events (create/modify/delete/rename) are forwarded to `dirtyPaths`.
 * The SyncPlanner reads this set at the start of each sync cycle; the
 * SyncExecutor calls `clearPath()` once a file has been successfully synced.
 *
 * ## Deferred-dirty mechanism during sync
 * While a sync is running, files that are actively being written by the
 * executor are registered via `markPathSyncing()`. Any vault event that
 * fires for a path currently in `syncingPaths` is placed in `deferredDirty`
 * instead of `dirtyPaths`. When the sync completes (`setSyncInProgress(false)`)
 * the deferred set is flushed into `dirtyPaths`, ensuring those files are
 * re-evaluated on the next cycle without triggering a spurious immediate
 * re-sync.
 *
 * ## Sync-aware event filtering
 * Files matching user-configured exclude patterns or recognised as conflict
 * artefacts (`LOCAL_` / `REMOTE_` prefixes) are silently dropped by
 * `shouldExclude()`.  Only `TFile` events are processed — folder events
 * (`TFolder`) are ignored because S3 has no real folder concept.
